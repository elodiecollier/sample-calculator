# takehome-challenge-app

## Instructions
1. Using a Terminal/Command Prompt window with the take-home-challenge-app open, navigate into the frontend subdirectory. Once there, type and enter 'ng serve --open" to start the Angular server and open the app in a default browser.
2. Using a separate Terminal/Command Prompt window with the take-home-challenge-app open, navigate into the backend subdirectory. Once there, type and enter 'rails server' to start the backend server.
3. Then, navigate to your default browser window where the app was opened during step 1. Right-click in the site window, and click 'Inspect'. From inside the pop-up, switch to the console tab. The log will contain a message 'Array()', and expanding this message will show the current contents of the database.
4. To test the app, type in a value where specified on the screen and submit it. You should see a message in the console log stating "Value added successful" as well as the two values being inserted into the database.
5. Tto see the newly added values in the database, refresh the page and expand the 'Array()' message in the console. Your user-inputted values have been added!
6. To exit, type and enter ^C into both Terminal/Command Prompt windows to safely end the servers.
